# Final Project - CMSC508 - Fall 2022

This project represents the culmination of our SQL journey this semester. As with homework 5, we'll be working with data downloaded from the world bank. For this assignment we'll be working with a full-size data base, no training wheels.

As with previous autograded assignments, there will be two major files of your making, a DDL file to create your data tables and a DML file for your queries.  These will be submitted for autograding using GITHUB.

YOU ARE RECOMMENDED TO SUBMIT USING GITHUB. Many of you for previous assignments were posting the individual DML and DDL files. For this assignment points will be awarded for use of GITHUB and submission of your REPO rather than individual files.

## Data source
We'll be using data downloaded from the World Bank data catalog of [world development Indicators](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037712/World-Development-Indicators).  Specifically, we'll be using the CSV files stored within this [ZIP file](https://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/WDI_csv.zip).

## Tasks for the Final Project

I have created starting tables for the project. Your early tasks in the project will require that you create copies using the **CREATE TABLE ... SELECT** command.

Like previous autograded assignments, the DDL and DML files will be broken into sections.  Within each section, I'll ask you to provide SQL code that performs a task that moves the data one step further down a data pipeline.

Follow the instructions in the different files, adding SQL as required and the assignment will walk you through a real-world example of data analysis using SQL.  Most data analysis projects follow the general workflow embedded within this assignment.

## Getting started!

You're well on your way, you're reading this README! Like other projects:
1. Use the invite I send you to create your homework 5 repository on classroom.github.com.
1. Clone the repo in VSCODE and store the repo on your local computer.
1. Like previous assignments, we'll be using your personal MySQL data base "202310_users_<eid>"
1. Add your code incrementally to the DDL and the DML files.  You can work with both files at the same time growing your code base in a test-driven fashion, writing your tests (SELECT statements) first, then adding the code to create the tables as you go.
1. When you're ready, visit the gradescope site and and submit your assignment to the autograder.

**NOTE** - Many of you noticed how long the autograder takes grade assignments, especially near the due date! The autograder only processes one assignment at a time, so if a whole bunch of you wait until the last minute to submit your assignments the wait time to get feedback on your assignment will be REALLY LONG!

**Please do not wait to the last minute to complete this final project!!**
